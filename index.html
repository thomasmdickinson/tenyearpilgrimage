            <h5>What is this?</h5>

            <p>A plan to complete a Doctor Who “pilgrimage” slowly over the span of ten years, beginning on 11/23/2023 and ending on 11/23/2033.</p>

            <h5>What is a pilgrimage?</h5>

            <p>In Doctor Who fandom jargon, the “Pilgrimage” is the act of watching all of Doctor Who in order from beginning to end. For some people this just means the “classic” (1963-1989) series, but for some people it means everything. In this case I’m using the term to mean everything from 1963 up til…. whatever is current or most recent as of 11/23/2033.</p>

            <h5>What about spin-offs?</h5>

            <p>I didn’t account for their episode count and running time when I was making this plan but sure, you could slot those in without too much trouble. If you would like to watch K-9 and Company in 2028 then I will not stand in your way. I’m not sure yet whether I personally will.</p>

            <h5>What about missing episodes?</h5>

            <p>If you’re reading this you are probably already a Doctor Who fan who knows that 97 episodes of Doctor Who from the 1960s are “missing.” And you probably also already know that there are various ways to enjoy those stories, including reconstructions, audio versions, or animations. The official position of this pilgrimage plan is: tackle those stories in whatever way you prefer, including skipping them if you want. It’s your pilgrimage!</p>

            <h5>How do I join?</h5>
            <p>There’s nothing to join! This is just an idea for how you might want to watch Doctor Who. You “join” by watching Doctor Who. If you want to do some more “joining”, try watching and discussing with your friends. If you are a social media user, on a platform that uses hashtags, maybe you can get the #10YearPilgrimage hashtag going. Start a movement.</p>

            <h5>Why those dates?</h5>
            <p>Doctor Who premiered on 11/23/1963. The start date is the sixtieth anniversary and the end date is the seventieth anniversary.</p>

            <h5>What’s with all the ???? in years Nine and Ten?</h5>
            <p>This plan is written in 2023, and we don’t yet know how much Doctor Who will be produced and released between now and 2033. For that reason, the exact shape of the schedule in the last few years is a bit vague. We have time to figure it out.

            <h5>How did you decide on the schedule?</h5>
            <p>A combination of guesswork, data analysis, and manual manipulation.</p>

            <p>Firstly, I figured it would make sense to leave about a year and a half to two years for the decade of content from 2023-2033, i.e. the Gatwa era and subsequent unknown eras. That meant fitting the first 60 years of Doctor Who into 8.5-9 years. </p>

            <p>Next, I wanted to have a mostly consistent amount of material from year to year, and given the various episode lengths I thought minutes of content was a more important thing to worry about than episode count. So I put all the episodes and their running times into a big spreadsheet and did some spreadsheet stuff to determine that the yearly minute count would need to be in the neighborhood of 3,000 minutes per year.</p>

            <p>And then I kind of fudged it to make the schedule “cleaner”. For instance, breaking most years at a regeneration, at the expense of minute count consistency. Obviously I couldn’t get it perfect. And I also had to awkwardly lump Eccleston into year 6 with the tail end of the classic series, and even so, that’s still the lightest year in terms of total viewing minutes. But I think this is pretty solid.</p>

            <h5>This schedule doesn’t make sense, it should be some other way.</h5>

            <p>Shrug. Pobody’s nerfect.</p>

            <h5>What if the show is canceled so there aren’t as many episodes as you’re expecting? Or what if the opposite happens, and there 2023-2033 has way MORE episodes than you’re expecting? Won’t that throw off the schedule for years nine and ten?</h5>

            <p>Yes. We’ll figure something out. </p>

            <h5>What kind of content is going to be on this website?</h5>

            <p>Almost nothing. I’m not blogging or podcasting about it or whatever.</p>

            <p>Here’s what you can expect to find on this website in the future:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>The 10-year schedule above, which may change</li>
              <li>In November 2023, I will post a week-by-week breakdown of the intended schedule for year one</li>
              <li>I'm hoping to make a bot for Mastodon/Fediverse that posts reminders about which episodes to watch on a weekly basis. Maybe an email and/or rss thing too if I can figure that out? We'll see.</li>
              <li>Hopefully in future years I’ll also post week-by-week breakdowns, but I’m not going to call that a promise. Maybe I’ll lose interest, or die. Ten years is a long time.</li>
              <li>I'll answer FAQs here if people ask me questions and I have things to say</li>
              <li>That’s it</li>
            </ol>
